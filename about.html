    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p1> I am a fourth-year student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. 
        I work as a Hardware Technician Intern at UnityPoint Health-Meriter Hospital. Growing up I was surrounded 
        by the day-to-day operations of my parent's small business. As an adolescent, I began helping out however 
        I could by solving technical computer problems, providing excellent customer service, and communicating 
        information surrounding the business. I am seeking a technical career that focuses on teamwork and software development.</p1>
